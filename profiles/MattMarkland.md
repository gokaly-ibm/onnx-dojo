Why here: I previously did some work with model development and deployment (at a different job) and I'm also a compiler developer so I find MLIR and those topics interesting. After I attended the BluePrint talk this looked like an intersting way to learn more.

Hobbies:
* Reading (non-fiction, sci-fi, fantasy).
* Role Playing Games
* Baseball (coaching and watching).
